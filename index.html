            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of Alberta, with an expected graduation in 2028. My academic journey has been marked by a commitment to excellence, earning me the Virginia Klatzel Scholarship in 2024 as the most outstanding student. Prior to university, I graduated from St. Francis High School in Calgary with Honors with Distinction and a GPA of 3.8. 
            </p>
                Beyond academics, I have hands-on experience in both technical and dynamic environments. As an onsite calibrator with Mapsted, I conducted advanced LiDAR scans and processed geospatial data to support indoor navigation technology. I also worked as a security worker at the Calgary Stampede, where I applied risk assessment and communication skills to help ensure the safety of thousands of visitors.
            <p>
                My technical skills include programming in Python, C++, and C, as well as experience with VHDL and ARM Assembly. I’m also proficient with MS Office, SolidWorks, and 3D printing. My projects range from building a demo banking program in C++ to handcrafting a kalimba, where I combined engineering principles with creativity and craftsmanship.   
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about problem-solving, learning new technologies, and collaborating with others. I value leadership, punctuality, and a positive, outgoing approach in every team I join. I’m excited to apply my skills and experience to new challenges in the field of electrical engineering.
